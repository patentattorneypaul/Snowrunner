# SnowRunner Comprehensive Tire Guide

## Overview
Tire selection is crucial for success in SnowRunner. This guide covers tire mechanics, performance attributes, and recommendations for each truck type based on the game's tire traction multipliers.

---

## Part 1: Understanding Tire Attributes

### Contact Surface Area
The amount of tire surface touching the ground directly affects traction and stability.

**Factors that increase contact surface area:**
- **Tire Width**: Wider tires provide more grip
- **Tire Diameter**: Larger tires increase ground clearance and contact area
- **Dual vs. Single Tires**: Switching from single to dual tires significantly improves stability and traction
- **Ultra-Wide Tires**: Premium tires with exceptionally wide profiles
- **Vehicle Wheels**: Trucks with more wheels (e.g., 6-wheel scouts) naturally have better traction

**Key Takeaway**: Bigger tires are almost always better. While they may slightly raise the center of mass, the benefits in challenging terrain far outweigh any stability concerns on flat surfaces.

### Traction Multipliers (Coefficients of Friction)
Traction multipliers determine how well tires grip on different surfaces. These values are not visible in-game but are documented in the [community tire spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ehuLHwbmA5ktr0ZC_gv52H3fkz3qxJY_i_uS7Gh0xRU/edit?gid=1733599403#gid=1733599403) by BladeChildX.

#### Surface Types:

| Surface Type | Description | Importance |
|---|---|---|
| **Asphalt (Body Friction Asphalt)** | Paved, un-iced roads | Low - Most tires perform well on asphalt |
| **Dirt (Body Friction)** | Dirt roads and hardened snow | Medium - Affects off-road performance |
| **Mud (Substance Friction)** | Mud and soft snow | **Critical** - Most challenging terrain accounts for majority of travel time |
| **Ice (Ignore Ice Flag)** | Icy surfaces and ice-plated roads | Medium - Chain tires have special attributes for ice |

**Strategic Principle**: Prioritize **mud performance** over dirt performance when choosing tires, as mud and soft snow consume disproportionately large amounts of travel time.

## Part 2: Tire Selection by Truck Type

### 1. Small Scouts

**Highway Tires:**
- **HS1** (Recommended): Better mud performance than HS2. Most small scouts come stock with HS1.
- HS2: Superior dirt performance, but inferior mud traction

**All-Terrain Tires:**
- **AS2** (Recommended): Prioritize the 0.2 mud performance advantage over AS1's dirt benefit

**Off-Road Tires:**
- **OS1** (Best for most): Superior dirt performance
- **Apache Special**: Uses TO1 tires (functionally identical to OS1)
- **Hummer H2 Custom**: Performs like OS1 in dirt/mud with better asphalt grip, but outperformed by MS-1s
- **MS-1** (Top tier): Unlock later in game; superior performance across all conditions

**Early Game Advantage**: Hummer H2 and Apache provide better starting tire performance than standard HS1 scouts.

---

### 2. Most Cargo Trucks, Loadstar & F750

This category has numerous tire options with similar performance unlocking at different ranks.

**Highway Tires:**
- **UHD1 or HMD1**: Choose based on truck availability
- **F750 (FMHD1)**: Custom tire, but UOD2 is superior once unlocked

**All-Terrain Tires:**
- **UAD2s and ATMD2s** (Best before off-road): Excellent all-around choice
- **ATHS1**: Early unlock with superior traction multipliers, but single rear tires reduce stability. Consider keeping double highway tires until ATMD2 unlocks if stability is priority.
- **Pacific P12 (P12AT)**: Replace with ATMD2 as soon as possible for better traction and stability

**Off-Road & Mud Tires:**
- **UOD2 or OHD1** (Recommended): Best options for most trucks
- **OHS1 & OHS2**: For trucks incompatible with double tires; OHS2 slightly better
- **Ank Mark 38 (ANKO Custom)**: Stock tires are decent but inferior to UOD2 or TMHS

**Mud Tires (General):**
- **MHS1**: Widely available but worst option. Sacrifices dirt value for minimal mud gain and lacks double rear tires. Avoid if OHS/OHD available.
- **MHS2 & MHS3**: Better than MHS1 but limited to single rear tires. Recommend sticking with OHD1 or OHS2 instead.
- **AMHS & TMHS** (Excellent): Extra-wide tires on all axles dramatically improve contact surface and stability. Available for select trucks needing stability (Bandit, Ank, Tuz twins). Recommended over OHD1/UOD2 despite slight dirt traction loss.

---

### 3. Super Heavy Trucks (745c, 4220 Antarctic, Voron D688A, Voron Grad)

Exclusive MSH tire line with minimal performance spread.

- **MSH2**: Highest mud rating
- **MSH3** (Potentially better): Recommended especially for articulated steering trucks. Reduces unpredictable sliding on dirt caused by weight and high center of mass.
- **MSH1** (Stock): Performs only slightly worse than top options, so upgrade pressure is minimal

---

### 4. Yar & Marshall (Special Scout Tires)

Specialized mud tires superior to all-terrain and off-road options.

- **TM1**: Stock on both trucks; superior to standard all-terrain options
- **TM2** (Recommended upgrade): Superior to TM1 following mud-over-dirt prioritization logic

**Comparison**: Yar 87 with TM2 and six wheels dominates tough terrain. Loadstar and F750 with UOD2 double tires are closest competitors, compensating with superior engine power and fewer wheels.

---

### 5. Irreplaceable Custom Tires

Some trucks have unique stock tires that cannot be changed:

- **Tatrin (TO1)**: Exceptionally good, particularly in deep mud/snow with unusually high traction multipliers
- **Pacific P16 & P512PF (Custom OHD1)**: Special OHD1 variant with much higher mud traction multiplier than standard OHD1

---

## Part 3: Chained Tires

### Specialization & Use Cases
Chained tires specialize in **ice, ice-plated roads, and ice-plated rock surfaces**. They are NOT universal best options and perform worse in deep snow compared to best off-road/mud tires.

**Most Useful In**:
- Pedro Bay, Alaska: Steep icy sideways slopes
- Mostly iced highways with minimal mud/snow

**Less Useful In**:
- Kola Peninsula: Significant deep snow negates ice advantage
- Good driving technique on non-chain tires often manages ice adequately

### Traction Multiplier Notes
Most chain tires (except CS1 for scouts) have identical asphalt, dirt, and mud numbers that don't correlate with non-chained counterparts.

### UAD3 Chains (Notable)
- Performs as well in dirt as best OHD1/UOD2 off-road tires
- Slightly better mud than best all-terrain tires
- All-chains selection puts chains on rear (counterintuitive but effective)

### Rear-Only Chains (Currently Useless)
Only UAD3 offers rear-chain option, but selecting "all chains" actually puts chains on rear and regular UAD3 on front—the opposite of what would be useful for tires where non-chain variant outperforms chain variant in mud.

## Part 4: Tire Selection Strategy Summary

| Priority | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **#1: Surface Type** | Prioritize **mud performance** (accounts for majority of difficult terrain) |
| **#2: Contact Area** | Larger/wider tires always better; dual rear tires > single |
| **#3: Dirt Performance** | Secondary consideration after mud |
| **#4: Asphalt Performance** | Lowest priority; most tires adequate |
| **#5: Stability** | Use wider/dual tires for high center-of-mass vehicles |

- **Asphalt**: Traction multiplier on paved roads (higher = better)
- **Dirt**: Traction multiplier on dirt/hardened snow (higher = better)
- **Mud**: Traction multiplier on mud/soft snow (higher = better)
