## 15. Clasico Pack

- This severely restricts utility in cargo-focused gameplay
- Limited payload capacity due to scout class
- Not suitable for primary cargo hauling roles

### Community Verdict

**Reddit Sentiment**: Highly divisive pack with strong opinions on both sides. Significant appreciation for aesthetics: "I am in love with the Chevrolet Apache" (59 upvotes) and "A day at work in small but powerful Chevy Apache" (107 upvotes) show strong cosmetic appeal. However, functional criticism appears with: "very disappointed in the chevy apache" (13 upvotes, 18 comments) pointing to utility issues.

**Steam Reviews**: Mixed reception - praised for looks and performance but criticized for the trailer incompatibility issue.

**Player Consensus**: More of a "show vehicle" than a workhorse. Players enjoy using it for exploration and non-cargo missions. The lack of trailer support is a recurring point of disappointment. Some consider it a cosmetic DLC rather than a practical addition.

### Performance Analysis

**Tatra 805 Strengths**

- "Driving the Tatra 805 be like:" (1,300 upvotes) - meme about its bouncy, unstable characteristics

- "Why are these two Tatra so expensive compared to other trucks?" (10 upvotes, 14 comments) - value concerns

**Player Consensus**: Niche DLC with specialized uses. Tatra 805 excels at fuel hauling and exploration but struggles with traditional cargo work. Tatra T813 is considered overpriced and outshined by other offroad options. Mainly for players who appreciate unique design and specific use cases.

**Recommendation**: 
- **Tatra 805**: Buy only if you want a dedicated fuel-hauling specialist with unique aesthetic appeal. Skip if you need versatile cargo trucks.
- **Tatra T813**: Questionable value. Other offroad trucks offer better all-around capability for similar price. Skip unless you're a completionist or Tatra enthusiast.

### Overview
A licensed 4x4 scout with impressive handling characteristics but limited utility due to its inability to tow trailers.

### Technical Specifications

**Engines**
- Het/8V 5.8
- Het/8V 6.2
- Het/8V 6.2T (turbo)

**Gearboxes**
- Stock
- Fine-tune
- Snowrunner
- Special 8-speed (8 Auto gears with 1.1 AWD penalty, excellent for fuel efficiency)

**Suspension**
- Stock (37")
- Raised (39")

**Tires**
- **Rezvani Tank** (2.6 pavement, 2.2 dirt, 1.1 mud)
- **Ultima CS I** (0.9 pavement, 1.3 dirt, 1.2 mud)
- **JAT MS III** (0.4 pavement, 2.1 dirt, 2.5 mud)

**Features**

- Engageable diff lock
- Snorkels (Front Facing & Tall Front Facing)
- Safety cage
- Repair kit pack (250 RP, stored in trunk)

### Critical Limitation
**Cannot pull trailers** - No trailer hitch available

### Performance Analysis

- Excellent pavement and dirt performance with the special 8-speed gearbox
- Outstanding fuel efficiency with the special transmission
- Good handling and suspension physics
- Lighter chassis and maximum ground clearance for agility
- Comprehensive customization options
- High power-to-weight ratio

**Weaknesses**
- Tips and flips easily compared to other scouts
- Struggles in deep mud/snow (like all sub-40" scouts)
- Wide rear with narrow tires causes stability issues

- Bumper tends to glitch into obstacles
- Gets stuck easily in minimal mud depth

### Community Verdict

**Steam Reviews**: 52% positive (Mixed rating with 38 total reviews)

**Player Consensus**: Niche collector's item for Rezvani/Jeep enthusiasts. Functionally redundant compared to existing scouts. The special 8-speed gearbox is the only unique feature, making this primarily a cosmetic DLC. The lack of trailer support is a significant drawback in a game focused on cargo hauling.

**Recommendation**: Skip unless you're a completionist or specifically want a Rezvani vehicle. The Hercules (larger Rezvani model) is considered superior by most players.

### Quirks & Notes
- Can withstand EMP from nuclear detonations (IRL manufacturer claim)
- Shares same "unlimited gears" engine sound problem with the original Rezvani
- Requires restoration and careful driving to avoid tipping
- Best used for pure exploration rather than cargo work

- **Better with Adjustments**: Using mid-tier engine (not strongest) and SnowRunner gearbox improves handling ~50%
- **Platform Issues**: Switch version exhibits worse performance issues than PC versions

**Player Consensus**: 
- **Collector's Item**: Primarily valued for their real-world appeal rather than gameplay utility

- **Quirk Appreciation**: Some players enjoy driving them despite acknowledged limitations, finding them "fun" and "pretty"

### Recommendations

- **Skip If**: You want optimal gameplay performance or already have other capable scouts
- **Viable Alternative**: Better to buy the Jeep DLC for superior scout capabilities
