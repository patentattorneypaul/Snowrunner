# Truck Classes in SnowRunner

## Highway Trucks

### Summary

Highway trucks are often overlooked in SnowRunner due to the lack of actual highways in the game. While initially considered useless by many players, certain highway trucks like the **GMC 9500** are actually usable and viable options.

**Examples:** Western Star 47X, Kenworth W990, GMC 9500

### Why Use Them?

- **Speed and Efficiency:** Good power-to-weight ratio, fast, and very fuel-efficient
- **Easy Routes:** Well-suited for easy routes or maps where speed and efficiency are beneficial

### Pros

- Good power-to-weight ratio
- Fast
- Usually very fuel-efficient
- Not bad for easy routes or maps

### Cons

- Not very capable; some struggle in mud
- Low ground clearance on some models
- Can be tippy
- Often feel unnecessary as a class

### Best Truck in Class (2025): Kenworth W990

**Why:** The Kenworth W990 is the current best highway truck due to its exceptional fuel capacity and range. It features:
- **Large Fuel Tank:** 380L capacity with extra fuel on the roof rack
- **Best in Class Tires:** Access to the biggest tires available for highway trucks
- **Good Engine:** Solid power delivery for the class
- **Fuel Efficiency:** Better suited for longer trips compared to the GMC MH9500 (240L capacity)
- **Practical Performance:** While it occasionally lacks all-wheel drive and may get stuck, the fuel advantages make it the most practical highway truck

**Note:** The GMC MH9500 was previously considered the best due to superior mud performance, but it requires finding the all-wheel drive upgrade in Kola Peninsula or playing New Game Plus to match the Kenworth's capability.

### Worst Truck in Class (2025): International Transtar 4070A

**Why:** The International Transtar 4070A is described as the "undisputed champion of being really bad" and the "true hard mode" of highway trucks:
- **Extreme Difficulty:** Makes every region extremely difficult
- **Poor Performance:** Severely underpowered and unsuitable for progression
- **Practical Uselessness:** Unless you have "8 hours a day" to spend on the game, it's essentially useless
- **Limited Use:** At best, can be used as a trailer for the Tuz Tatarin
- **Similar Issues:** The Ford CLT shares similar poor performance

## Heavy-Duty Trucks

### Summary

Heavy-duty trucks are considered the "actual forgotten class" with no new additions in about three years. However, unlike highway trucks, they are **really useful** and more capable than most players realize. They are good enough for most regions and don't need to be "absolutely fantastic" to be worthwhile.

**Examples:** International HX 520, Cat CT681, GMC Brigadier, White Western Star

### When to Use Them?

- **Versatility:** Provide access to a variety of add-ons for different tasks
- **Balanced Performance:** Offer a good middle ground between fuel-thirsty heavy trucks and less capable highway trucks
- **Capability:** More capable than highway trucks and usable in most regions
- **Fuel Economy:** Not as fuel-thirsty compared to heavy and off-road trucks
- **Maintaining Challenge:** Using them keeps the game challenging and fresh, even in easier regions
- **Better Alternative:** Definitively better than some Scout classes and enjoyable to drive

### Pros

- More capable than highway trucks
- Good middle ground in performance
- Fuel-efficient compared to heavy trucks
- Plenty of add-on options
- Keeps gameplay fresh and challenging

### Cons

- Often overlooked and underutilized by players
- Slow DLC release schedule (no new trucks in ~3 years)

### Best Truck in Class (2025): Kenworth C500

### Worst Truck in Class (2025): Mack Pinnacle

**Why:** The Mack Pinnacle falls short as a heavy-duty truck and is considered significantly weaker:
- **Inferior to Competitors:** Performs like a "weaker version of the Kenworth W990"
- **Limited Capability:** Performance is "really not good enough" for a heavy-duty truck
- **All-Wheel Drive Issues:** Lacks all-wheel drive in certain situations, similar to the W990
- **Small Tires:** Comes with smaller tires, limiting capability
- **Overshadowed:** Other heavy-duty trucks like Chevrolet Kodiak, Fleetstar, and White Western Star all offer better performance
- **Minor Compensation:** While it has more fuel capacity and cool add-ons, these don't compensate for its overall weakness

## Heavy Trucks

### Summary

Heavy trucks are the powerhouses of SnowRunner, designed for the most challenging terrain and cargo operations. These vehicles are equipped with maximum power, all-terrain capabilities, and heavy load-carrying capacity. While fuel-thirsty, they are essential for tackle the game's most demanding missions.

**Examples:** Tayga 6436, Likhachev 6x6, Voron D-Model 260, Azov 6x6, Waidong W43XX, Hummer H1

### When to Use Them?

- **Maximum Power:** Best choice for the toughest terrain and cargo
- **Heavy Loads:** Essential for carrying massive payloads and trailers
- **Challenging Regions:** Necessary for late-game regions with extreme terrain difficulty
- **Mud and Snow:** Superior traction and power for deep mud, rivers, and steep slopes
- **Specialized Missions:** Required for specific tasks that demand maximum capability
- **Backup and Recovery:** Can recover or assist other stuck vehicles

### Pros

- Maximum power and torque
- Superior traction and all-terrain capability
- Best at handling extreme terrain (deep mud, water crossings, steep hills)
- Heavy-duty suspensions and frames
- Can handle the most difficult cargo missions
- Unmatched reliability in extreme conditions

### Cons

- Extremely fuel-thirsty (poor fuel economy)
- Slower than most other classes
- Limited maneuverability on tight spaces due to size
- Higher operational costs
- Can be overkill for easier tasks
- Heavy weight affects overall speed

### Best Truck in Class (2025): Kenworth 963

**Why:** The Kenworth 963 has earned recognition as the best heavy truck through exceptional all-around performance:

- **Flexible Add-ons:** Supports crane, long bed, and trailer combo simultaneously for maximum versatility
- **Excellent Stability:** "Extremely stable" and resistant to rollovers
- **Massive Fuel Tank:** 510L capacity plus extra roof rack fuel for long operations
- **Great Workhorse:** Used for about half of all in-game activities
- **Overall Balance:** Offers the best combination of power, capability, stability, and fuel capacity

**Note:** Other heavy trucks like the ZikZ 605R and ZikZ 62H are also good, but the Kenworth 963 stands as the superior choice.

### Worst Truck in Class (2025): Cat 770G

**Why:** The Cat 770G is considered "useless" and "the worst heavy truck in the game" despite having decent performance:
- **Severely Limited Add-ons:** Cannot attach any trailers, drastically reducing utility
- **Poor Add-on Selection:** Lacks good or useful add-ons
- **Inadequate Fuel Solution:** Only useful add-on is a 2,000L fuel tank, which is insufficient
- **Outclassed by Alternatives:** Comparable fuel tanks on other trucks (Tatra Phoenix, Tatra Force) or even normal trucks with fuel carrier trailers offer similar or more fuel with greater utility
- **Niche Use Only:** Best hoped for use would be as a dump truck (not yet implemented in SnowRunner)
- **Practical Uselessness:** The combination of restrictions makes it unsuitable for most tasks

## General Observations

### No Fictional Trucks

Neither highway nor heavy-duty classes contain any fictional trucks; all vehicles are licensed real-world models.

### Classification Similarities

Some highway and heavy-duty trucks share similar appearances to "heavy trucks," questioning the classification criteria between these classes.

### DLC Release Pattern

- No heavy-duty or highway trucks have been released as part of SnowRunner seasons
- All have been standalone DLC releases
- The creator suggests combining a heavy-duty or highway truck with a heavy truck in future seasons would be better than the current Scout + heavy truck seasonal system
