 - Michigan: **S+ Tier** ([0:26](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=26))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** The speaker considers it the perfect region because it's not too difficult, possesses unique character, and its maps are designed to avoid boredom. He also appreciates that contracts don't demand excessive cargo deliveries, and it features many valuable trucks ([0:30](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=30)-[1:25](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=85)).
	 - **Summary:** As the game's initial region, Michigan offers a balanced challenge and engaging maps that remain interesting. Missions are well-paced, requiring fewer large cargo deliveries.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Many good trucks, including the Twin Steer ([1:15](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=75)).

 - Alaska: **S Tier** ([1:29](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=89))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** It largely mirrors Michigan's positive attributes. The primary drawback is that "one or two of the maps," specifically Pedro Bay, can "feel a bit empty" and don't necessitate much time, unlike Michigan where every map offers distinct content ([1:32](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=92)-[1:54](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=114)).
	 - **Summary:** A strong snowy region sharing many strengths with Michigan. However, certain maps, like Pedro Bay, can feel less populated or engaging.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Not explicitly mentioned, but implied to have good trucks like Michigan.

 - Tamyr: **S Tier** ([2:09](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=129))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** The speaker highly values the experience of driving heavy trucks through harsh mud terrain, a feeling this map provides abundantly and uniquely. A minor detractor is one map that "doesn't have much to offer" ([2:14](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=134)-[2:48](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=168)).
	 - **Summary:** Offers a fantastic and distinctive experience of navigating extreme mud environments. Like some other regions, it includes one map with limited content.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Some of the best trucks in the game, including the Tega 6436 ([2:54](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=174)).

 - Kola Peninsula: **B Tier** ([3:07](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=187))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** While "one of the most beautiful regions," it suffers from fewer missions compared to original regions and a scarcity of good truck unlocks. The second map, Imandra, is notably "very difficult" ([3:13](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=193)-[4:12](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=252)).
	 - **Summary:** Visually striking, yet it provides fewer missions and lacks strong truck rewards. Its second map, Imandra, presents a significant challenge.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Ford F750 (a decent scout) ([3:27](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=207)).

 - Yukon: **C Tier** ([4:22](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=262))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** The speaker labels it one of the "worst regions" due to the constant need to "go up and down the same road all the time" and perform "the same thing over and over." The requirement to deliver "tons of cargos to the same location" renders it "a bit boring" ([4:40](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=280)-[4:54](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=294)).
	 - **Summary:** A blend of snow and mud environments. This region is perceived as monotonous because of repetitive tasks that involve delivering large cargo volumes to identical locations via the same routes.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Not explicitly mentioned, but described as "not that great either" ([4:57](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=297)).

 - Wisconsin: **A Tier** ([5:03](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=303))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** It's hailed as a "very good region" featuring "genuinely some of the best missions." The speaker's main criticisms are the limited time spent in the second map, despite a cool train mission, and certain contracts demanding "so much cargo" for crafting ([5:15](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=315)-[5:49](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=349)).
	 - **Summary:** A strong region boasting some of the game's best missions, including a notable train-pulling task. However, much gameplay is confined to the first map, and some contracts require excessive cargo deliveries.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Not bad, except for the Pacific P512PF ([5:05](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=305)).

 - Amur: **C Tier** ([6:04](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=364))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** While challenging and content-rich, the speaker "personally don't really like Amur that much." He argues a difficult region "should not have four maps" as it takes too long to complete. He also dislikes the prevalent visual monotony ("pretty much everywhere look the same") and the difficult initial phase with blocked roads and bridges ([6:15](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=375)-[7:12](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=432)).
	 - **Summary:** Extremely challenging and extensive, demanding considerable time to complete its four maps. However, its repetitive scenery and a difficult beginning can hinder enjoyment.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Not explicitly mentioned.

 - Don: **D Tier** ([7:35](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=455))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** It's considered "one of the worst regions" because its maps are "way smaller" than others and "doesn't have anything" substantial. The speaker finds the maps repetitive, leading to rapid monotony due to a lack of content and missions ([7:55](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=475)-[8:35](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=515)).
	 - **Summary:** Ranked among the worst regions, characterized by small, empty, and repetitive maps with insufficient content. Despite unlocking good trucks, the region quickly becomes tedious.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Tatra Force and Tatra Phoenix ([7:43](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=463)).

 - Maine: **B Tier** ([8:42](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=522))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** The speaker describes it as "not that bad, but...not that great either." He appreciates the unique garage repair mission and frequent water traversals. However, he dislikes the second map and the numerous bridges and areas that "just cannot fix," even after attempted repairs ([8:47](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=527)-[10:12](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=612)).
	 - **Summary:** An interesting and somewhat difficult region, notable for its unique garage challenge and frequent water travel. Its second map is a point of contention, and many broken areas remain unfixable.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Tega 6455B and the Aroamatsu Forester ([9:31](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=571)).

 - Tennessee: **Worst Region** ([10:17](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=617))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** The speaker deems it "genuinely a bad region" and "probably the worst region" as it "feels very incomplete." He criticizes the "not that great" trucks, "a bit repetitive" and limited missions, and feels the racing theme doesn't align with SnowRunner's core gameplay ([10:20](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=620)-[11:04](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=664)).
	 - **Summary:** This region feels unfinished, offering repetitive and limited missions. Its racing focus is seen as mismatched with the typical SnowRunner experience, making it generally unappealing.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Azov Sprinter (decent for scouting) ([10:27](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=627)).

 - Glades: **High A Tier** (almost S Tier) ([11:10](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=670))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** The speaker "loves this region" and nearly placed it in S tier. His only reservation is the "just too much farming to do," which "could get a bit boring." Otherwise, the environment is "absolutely fantastic" and "very unique," missions are "really cool," and maps are "really good" ([11:10](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=670)-[11:55](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=715)).
	 - **Summary:** Features a visually unique and fantastic farming environment with enjoyable missions and well-designed maps. Its primary drawback is the extensive farming required, which can become monotonous.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Not explicitly mentioned.

 - Ontario: **C Tier** ([12:01](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=721))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** It's "a bit boring" because players "need to deliver thousands and thousands and thousands of liters of water to these couple of locations," making it repetitive. Additionally, in the first map, players "drive on the same roads all the time and visit the same locations all the time" ([12:06](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=726)-[12:39](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=759)).
	 - **Summary:** Becomes monotonous due to repetitive deliveries of large quantities of water to a few locations, forcing players to repeatedly traverse the same roads. The burnt forest is a notable visual element.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Not bad ([12:50](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=770)).

 - British Columbia: **A Tier** ([12:58](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=778))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** It's praised for being "really not that difficult," allowing the use of "basically any truck." It's highly recommended for unlocking the "two of the best trucks in the game." Beyond the trucks, it's a "very good region to play" with "many cutscenes" and extensive building tasks ([13:02](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=782)-[13:42](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=822)).
	 - **Summary:** A relatively easy region that accommodates various truck types and features numerous cutscenes and construction missions, including a unique boat delivery. It's an excellent region for acquiring powerful trucks.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Mack Defense and Kenworth 963 (two of the best trucks in the game) ([13:10](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=790)).

 - Scandinavia: **S+ Tier** ([13:51](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=831))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** The speaker declares it "the best DLC region" due to its "stunning" mixed mud and snow environment and "amazing" quest-line missions that feel fresh and engaging, unlike typical tasks. It is also not overly difficult ([13:57](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=837)-[14:26](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=866)).
	 - **Summary:** Considered the top DLC region, featuring breathtaking mixed terrain environments and outstanding quest-based missions that offer a fresh experience. It presents a manageable challenge.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Berlac 6x6 (a good scout) and another smaller scout ([14:37](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=877)).

 - North Carolina: **B Tier** ([14:51](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=891))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** It's "not that bad" with a "good mix of easy and difficult train" and "beautiful" visuals. However, "some of the missions...are a bit pointless and some of the things...feels a bit stretched," such as fixing roads that are never used again ([14:58](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=898)-[15:34](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=934)).
	 - **Summary:** A decent region offering varied terrain and pleasant visuals. However, some missions feel redundant, and content can seem drawn out, with unnecessary road-clearing tasks.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Not explicitly mentioned.

 - Almaty: **A Tier** ([15:37](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=937))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** Despite having only one map, it feels "very big" due to its extensive quarries and provides "enough content," good missions, and environments. The speaker believes it "had the potential to be S tier if it had two maps" ([15:37](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=937)-[16:19](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=979)).
	 - **Summary:** Even with just one map, its large quarries and solid content make it feel substantial. It offers engaging missions and good environments.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Gor BY-50 (one of the best trucks) and an AIC (normal scout) ([15:54](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=954)).

 - Austria: **S Tier** ([16:31](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=991))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** It's "one of the best" regions. While it has some farming, it's less than Glades. The speaker highlights "some of the most beautiful things and areas in the whole game," including "very cool castles, towns, factories, warehouses." The roads are "well-designed," offering diverse routes based on truck capability, and the two maps connect "in such a great way" ([16:35](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=995)-[17:37](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=1057)).
	 - **Summary:** Ranked among the best, it features stunning castles, towns, and factories. Its thoughtfully designed roads provide flexible routes, and the two maps seamlessly merge, creating the impression of a single vast area.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Two tractors (including the Foton) and two scouts (best scouts in the game with unique radar add-on) ([17:40](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=1060)).

 - Quebec: **A Tier** ([17:58](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=1078))
	 - **Reason for Rank:** The speaker considers it the "best one" among the difficult regions. He dislikes the initial 20% due to pervasive road problems and fixed roads becoming "pointless." However, "after that, everything is amazing," with unique areas and towns. He particularly appreciates the "big change of pace" after the main highway is fixed, shifting from crawling to quick travel ([18:06](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=1086)-[19:37](https://youtu.be/sIRnMSLeUnI?t=1177)).
	 - **Summary:** This region stands out as the best among the difficult ones. It begins challenging with numerous broken roads, but once the main highway is repaired, the gameplay tempo dramatically changes, offering an enjoyable and visually varied experience.
	 - **Trucks unlocked:** Not explicitly mentioned.
