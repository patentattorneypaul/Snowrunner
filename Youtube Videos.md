## [The Forgotten Classes of SnowRunner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eNBEAvsu3w)

An in-depth discussion of the often-overlooked Highway and Heavy-Duty truck classes in SnowRunner, exploring why players underestimate them and when they should be used.

**Key topics:**
- Highway trucks: Speed and fuel efficiency for easy routes, with the GMC 9500 and Kenworth W990 highlighted as usable options
- Heavy-Duty trucks: The "actual forgotten class" that is more useful than perceived, offering versatility and balanced performance
- No fictional trucks in either class; all are licensed real-world vehicles
- DLC release patterns: Both classes have only received standalone DLC releases, never as part of seasons
- Creator's suggestion: Future seasons should pair a heavy-duty or highway truck with a heavy truck instead of the Scout + heavy truck system
