Here is the recommended play order for SnowRunner regions based on [this video guide](https://youtu.be/xGdntKJ4vNw?si=Ihwmwnf4cAsdd_wS&t=189):

## 1. **Original Regions** (0:36-1:20)
These are the best starting regions because they are forgiving, allowing players to learn the game mechanics, unlock numerous trucks, essential upgrades, and earn money and levels.

## 2. **British Columbia** (Season 15) (1:22-2:52)
This region is a good follow-up due to its manageable difficulty and the powerful trucks it unlocks, such as the Mac Defense and Kenworth 963, which are valuable for the entire game.

## 3. **Scandinavia** (Season 11) (2:55-4:23)
Serving as an excellent tutorial for DLC regions, Scandinavia introduces new mechanics like crafting, generators, and limited cargo locations, preparing players for more complex challenges.

## 4. **Kola Peninsula** (Season 1) (4:26-5:24)
This region presents the first significant challenge, showcasing the game's difficulty. The strong trucks acquired earlier will be crucial for navigating this demanding environment and unlocking valuable upgrades like the Western Star Twin Steer's all-wheel drive.

## 5. **Wisconsin** (Season 3) (5:43-6:22)
After a recommended break, Wisconsin offers a balanced mix of easy and difficult areas with unique contracts. It requires significant cargo delivery, making previously unlocked heavy trucks very useful.

## 6. ~~**Dawn**~~ (Season 5) (6:25-7:18)
*Skippable* - This region has small maps, repetitive roads, and limited content, even though it unlocks the Tatra Phoenix and Tatra Force trucks.

## 7. **Austria** (Season 14) (7:20-8:23)
Austria is a beautiful and enjoyable region that introduces farming mechanics and unlocks two of the best scout vehicles, the Earth ROR trucks, known for their unique radar add-on.

## 8. **North Carolina** (Season 12) (8:26-8:57)
This four-map region offers many missions and unlocks the highly capable FEM 3780 truck, though some missions might feel repetitive.

## 9. **Maine** (Season 6) (9:05-10:10)
After another break, Maine presents a significant challenge, especially its second map. Players will need to restore a broken garage and face various terrains like mud, snow, and breakable ice.

## 10. ~~**Tennessee**~~ (Season 7) (10:13-10:59)
*Skippable* - Limited content, only one map, repetitive missions, and doesn't unlock particularly strong trucks.

## 11. **Quebec** (Season 15) (11:02-11:42)
This difficult region becomes easier as contracts are completed, making early mission prioritization important. It also offers unique cutscenes and unlocks the Mercer K520 and Elephant trucks.

## 12. **Glades** (Season 8) (11:45-12:34)
A favorite of the author, Glades is a beautiful and unique four-map region with many good missions, although it involves farming, which some players find repetitive.

## 13. ~~**Yukon**~~ (Season 2) (12:43-13:59)
*Skippable* - Despite its size and introduction of crafting, it can be boring due to repetitive routes and extensive cargo delivery, and it unlocks the "most useless truck," the Cat 770G.

## 14. **Almati** (Season 13) (13:54-14:38)
Although a single-map region, Almati offers substantial content with large quarries and good missions. It also unlocks the versatile Plat 450 truck.

## 15. **Ontario** (Season 9) (14:43-15:17)
This cool region features a burnt forest and good trucks, but the firefighting and water delivery missions can be monotonous. It offers a mix of easy and difficult areas.

## 16. **Amore** (Season 4) (15:22-16:17)
The final and most challenging region in the game, Amore tests all the skills and trucks acquired throughout the journey. It's designed to be tackled with extensive knowledge and a powerful fleet, making its completion very satisfying.
